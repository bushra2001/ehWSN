# ehWSN
the project aims at developing and evaluating the performance of a number of node energy control methods that determine how a node uses the stored energy in day-to-day operation. Project work relies on developing a discrete-event simulation (DES) program (e.g., using OMNET++) for EHWSNs with routing functionality included.
